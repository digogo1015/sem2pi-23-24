# US 017 - List deals made  

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a network manager, I want to list all deals made.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>  


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Regarding the Algorithms, is it supposed to be one for each sorting order, or must both algorithms present both sorting orders?
>
> **Answer:** The two algorithms can be used for both sorting orders.


> **Question:** We have to present information about the deal, but is it necessary to display any information about the agent/agency that oversees the deal?
>
> **Answer:** Yes, show the store ID and the store name.


> **Question:** Can you confirm that we are analyzing the deals made in all the branches all together?
>
> **Answer:** Yes, we are analyzing the deals made in all the branches all together.


> **Question:** In this User Story it is requested that "All deals made" are listed. Are these deals just accepted purchase requests, or are declined purchase requests also included?
>
> **Answer:** A deal takes place when the proposed purchase/renting is accepted.


> **Question:** What should be the default order of the deals when displaying them to the network manager?
>
> **Answer:** The default is to sort deals from the most recent ones to the oldest ones.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The actor should be able to sort all properties by property area (square feet)
  in descending/ascending order.

 
* **AC2:** Two sorting algorithms should be implemented (to be chosen manually by
  the network manager).


* **AC3:** Worst-case time complexity of each algorithm should be documented in the
  application user manual that must be delivered with the application (in the
  annexes, where algorithms should be written in pseudocode).


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to "US011 : Accept or decline purchase orders" since to be able to list all deals made, there must be deals created beforehand, specifically through accepting advertisement purchase orders.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Selected data:
  * Sorting methods
  * Order option (ascending/descending)

* **Output Data:**

  * (In)Success of the operation
